This is a set of perl scripts (client and server) that redirect the input and output of gdb (or any program really) over the network to a server, so that multiple nodes can run gdb without the need for each to have a terminal, as gdb usually needs.

fib.c is a program I wrote as a small test.
mpi_pong.c is a program written by Dave Turner that I use to test MPI.


HOW TO USE
----------
Make sure that your program has something like:
 sprintf(dbg, "perl -w client.pl %s %d 1 &", argv[0], getpid());
 system(dbg);
 sleep(5);

 The arguments to client are "name of program" "pid" "mpirank"

start a server in one window
  perl -w server.pl
start the mpi job in another
if you want, start the viewer in another
	perl -w viewer.pl <mpi rank of host you want to watch>
When the debugging output comes
 a <command> - sends a command to all nodes
 # <command> - sends a command to node #

 Note, when using the viewer, you do not need to prepend the # of
 the node, that is automatic.  However, p and a commands (p commands
 to pgdb and a is to all nodes) get passed along as normal.
